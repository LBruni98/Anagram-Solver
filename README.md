# Project-003
Anagram Solver for three letters

#### Flowchart

![Flowchart](https://github.com/LBruni98/Project-003/blob/master/Untitled%20Diagram.jpg)

Here is the main layout for what I'm trying to do. The flowchart shows that the program create the dictionary, store the input, compare with a dictionary and statements that plan to create specific letter inputs and if the word matches with the dictionary. The code will be written out in C++, mainly because of the requirements requesting for the program to be created in this language, but also the fact that the language is more object oriented, mainly because the prgram relies on storing data.

#### Evaluation
The program had carried out the tasks laid out in the flowchart and user stories and C++ had mangaed to carry out the functions with ease. C++ helps with being more data oriented as it helps with the methods included in the code and that its ease with reading files and using the file to help with word comparison. The language takes most of its roots from C making it compile well with the language and is fairly felxable and prior knowledge helps with the development of most of the functions, albeit the coding language is a tad difficult because of the slightly different syntax to learn
